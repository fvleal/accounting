## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Setup]: MUI + Tailwind CSS together (user preference, overrides research recommendation for Headless UI only)
- [Setup]: Auth0 same tenant as backend — audience and RBAC config must be verified before any API call is written
- [Setup]: Backend already exists at localhost:3000 — no BFF, no backend work needed
- [Phase 01]: CSS layer order: theme, mui, components, utilities for MUI + Tailwind coexistence
- [Phase 01]: StyledEngineProvider enableCssLayer wraps MUI in @layer mui for specificity control
- [Phase 01]: TokenGetterInitializer child component wires setTokenGetter inside Auth0Provider
- [Phase 01]: Auth0Provider in App.tsx (inside BrowserRouter) for useNavigate access
- [Phase 01]: Container maxWidth="sm" for centered content matching Google Personal Info layout
- [Phase 01]: Replaced withAuthenticationRequired HOC with custom useAuth0() guard to preserve branded /login page
- [Phase 01]: ProtectedRoute renders Outlet as layout route wrapper instead of accepting component prop

### Pending Todos

- Layout/styling improvements needed (user reported layout looks bad after login)

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Auth0 dashboard access confirmed — Authorization Code grant enabled, login flow works
- [Phase 5]: Backend FormData field name and file size limit for photo upload endpoint not yet confirmed — must check NestJS controller before building upload mutation
- [Phase 4]: Brazilian phone format expected by backend not yet confirmed — must verify before building EditPhoneModal
